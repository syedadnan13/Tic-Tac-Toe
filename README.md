# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can take turns marking their spaces on a 3x3 grid, and the game checks for wins or draws.

Key Features  
1. Two-Player Mode: Players can alternate turns, playing as "X" and "O".  
2. Win Detection: The game checks for winning combinations after each turn.  
3. Draw Detection: The game can also detect when all spaces are filled without a winner.  
4. Reset Functionality: Players can restart the game after a win or draw.  

How to Play  
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.  
2. Click on any empty box to place your mark ("X" or "O").  
3. The game will automatically check for a winner or a draw after each turn.  
4. If the game ends, click the "Play Again" button to reset the game.  

Technologies Used  
1. HTML: Structure of the game interface.  
2. CSS: Styling for the game layout and visual effects.  
3. JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.  

JavaScript Logic  
1. Event Listeners: Each box in the grid has an event listener that triggers when clicked, allowing players to make their move.  
2. Turn Management: The game keeps track of whose turn it is and updates the display accordingly.  
3. Win and Draw Checks: The game checks for winning conditions and draws using predefined conditions stored in an array.
